# Analyzing California Wildfires (2018-2024)

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to the wildfires in California from 2018 to 2024. The analysis covers various aspects of the wildfires, including the number of structures damaged or destroyed, acres burned, and the impact of different regions in the state. The goal is to uncover trends and insights to help improve fire management, preparedness, and resilience in wildfire-prone areas.

## Key Insights
- **Wildfire Trends**: Identified patterns in wildfire frequency, with significant increases in 2020, driven by the *Camp Fire* and other major incidents.
- **Impact on Structures**: Analyzed the types of structures most affected by fires, including residential, commercial, and agricultural properties.
- **Damage vs. Acreage Burned**: Investigated the correlation between the acres burned and the number of structures destroyed, showing a weak positive correlation.
- **Region-Specific Findings**: Found that Northern California, particularly counties like Butte, was more severely impacted than Southern or Central California.

## Data Sources
Dataset obtained from **California Natural Resources Agency** and **Frontline Wildfire Defense** <br>
